The Gunner Technology Predictive 404 plugin assists in PageRank recovery.

== Description ==

Another plugin inspired by Russ Jones' post on [SEOMoz](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/set-it-and-forget-it-seo-chasing-the-elusive-passive-seo-dream "Set it and forget it seo"), this plugin assists in PageRank recovery by:

* Capturing the URL that the visitor or GoogleBot tried to visit.
* Using Levenshtein Distance to figure out the intended URL.
* 301 redirecting to there

For example, browsing to http://gunnertech.com/internet-markteing will automagically redirect to http://gunnertech.com/internet-marketing
