== Description ==

The Gunner Technology Pinboard plugin leverages Twitter Boostrap, Ajax and jQuery Masonry to create a personal Pinterest-type view of photos for WordPress authors.

We creating the plugin using a Custom Post Type, which you can use very much like a simple post. What you set as the "Featured Image" will appear as the photo for the pin. 

You can categorize the pins by pinboards for more fine-grained retrieval via the shortcode.

Finally, the admin panel will allow you to filter your pins by the pinboard taxonomy.

You can see it in action on one of our [clients' sites](http://sourcephotographysf.gunnertechnetwork.net/product-photography/).
